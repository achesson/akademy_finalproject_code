Most of the text content is in Hindi language, also some keywords are mentioned in the English language to better understand the same.  \n\nThe goal of the HHD corpus is to provide researchers with a platform which details about different types of diseases, their descriptions, symptoms, treatments and home remedies respectively. As per our knowledge, no such detailed corpus is made available online so far.\n\nHHD corpus is  interpreted and analysed to perform the NER task in the Hindi using vivid NLP techniques. The gazetteer lists for Named Entities (NEs) such as Person, Disease, Consumable and Symptom are also provided. Further, more NEs can be identified and classified from the HHD corpus such as Food, Quantity, Diagnosis etc. by the keen researchers. \n\nWe welcome researchers to enhance and upgrade the corpus to further extent. And also, request them to cite the same whenever it seems worthwhile for their research.

We used a Muse EEG headband which recorded the TP9, AF7, AF8 and TP10 EEG placements via dry electrodes. \n\nOur method of statistical extraction resampled the data since waves must be mathematically described in a temporal fashion. \n\nIf you would like to use the data in research projects, please cite the following:\n\nJ.

We used a Muse EEG headband which recorded the TP9, AF7, AF8 and TP10 EEG placements via dry electrodes. \n\nOur method of statistical extraction resampled the data since waves must be mathematically described in a temporal fashion. \n\nIf you would like to use the data in research projects, please cite the following:\n\nJ.
