# akademy_finalproject_code

After 8 weeks of intensive coding, our final 2 weeks centered around creating a practical start-to-finish AI solution. for my project I wanted to contribute towards sustainable development by aggregating and tagging machine learning datasets from the web that related to the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This would allow greater accessibility and engagement among data scientists by allowing them to select datasets for their own projects based on where they want to have the most impact.

This repository contains all the notebooks used to deliver the final demo and presentation, annotated with some of my reflections and learnings.
